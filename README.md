# Optimization-Methods (in Matlab)
The repository encompasses three folders named GA, ACO, and ICA, which are three bio-inspired optimization methods. 
# ACO
ACO is ant colony optimization algorithm. I have used ACO for solving the **channel allocation problem** in "Ad Hoc Wireless Networks"
# ICA
 Imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) has been used for solving the **channel allocation problem** in "Ad Hoc Wireless Networks"
 For more information related to #ICA refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperialist_competitive_algorithm
 # GA
 Genetic Algorithm  has been used for solving the **channel allocation problem** in "Ad Hoc Wireless Networks"
